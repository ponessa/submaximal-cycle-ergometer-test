Welcome to my Submaximal Cycle Ergometer Test documentation project, aimed at standardizing product documentation through the use of GitHub Pages! 

A submaximal cycle ergometer test estimates VO₂ max by having participants cycle at a moderate intensity, typically 60-85% of their max heart rate. Heart rate is monitored as the workload gradually increases, and VO₂ max is predicted based on the heart rate response at submaximal effort.

The documentation repository is located on GitHub at ([https://github.com/ponessa/submaximal-cycle-ergometer-test](https://github.com/ponessa/submaximal-cycle-ergometer-test){:target="_blank"}). 

The site is generated using [The Documentation Tool](https://github.com/ponessa/the-documentation-tool), that can be used for creating and publishing professional-looking documentation websites.
