  A submaximal cycle ergometer test estimates VO2 max by having participants cycle at a moderate intensity, typically 60-85% of their max heart rate. Heart rate is monitored as the workload gradually increases, and VO2 max is predicted based on the heart rate response at submaximal effort.

## Submaximal cycle ergometer test

A submaximal cycle ergometer test is a cardiovascular fitness assessment used to estimate an individual's aerobic capacity or VO₂ max (maximum oxygen uptake) without requiring them to perform at their maximum effort. It involves cycling on a stationary bike (ergometer) at a predetermined submaximal intensity, meaning the participant exercises below their maximum capacity. The test is designed to evaluate how the heart, lungs, and muscles work together under controlled conditions.

Key points of a submaximal cycle ergometer test:

1. **Intensity**: The participant cycles at a moderate intensity, typically 60-85% of their predicted maximum heart rate, and the workload may increase in stages.
2. **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Heart rate is tracked throughout the test. The relationship between heart rate and exercise intensity is used to predict the individual's VO₂ max.
3. **Duration**: The test generally lasts 6-12 minutes, depending on the protocol used, with regular increases in resistance or workload.
4. **Predicted VO₂ Max**: Based on heart rate response at the submaximal workload, a formula is used to estimate VO₂ max without pushing the participant to their limit.

This test is safer and less physically demanding than maximal tests, making it suitable for individuals who may not be able to perform a maximal test due to fitness level, health concerns, or other limitations. It is often used in clinical, fitness, and rehabilitation settings.
